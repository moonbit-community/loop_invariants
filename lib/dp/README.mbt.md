# DP Optimization Techniques (Reference)

A collection of dynamic programming optimizations such as convex hull trick
and deque-based optimizations.

## What it demonstrates

- Convex hull trick for linear DP transitions
- Monotone queue optimizations
- Careful invariant reasoning for DP correctness

## Pseudocode sketch

```mbt nocheck
add_line(m, b)
query(x) -> best value
```

## Notes

- This package is a reference implementation with invariants
- Use when optimizing DP with linear or convex transitions
