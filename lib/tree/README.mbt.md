# Tree Utilities (Reference)

Tree-oriented data structures and algorithms, including Fenwick and segment
trees adapted for tree queries.

## What it demonstrates

- Flattening a tree for range structures
- Fenwick tree on Euler order
- Segment tree for subtree/path queries

## Pseudocode sketch

```mbt nocheck
flatten tree with Euler tour
use range structure on the order array
```

## Notes

- This package is a reference implementation with invariants
