# Math Utilities (Reference)

A collection of number-theory and math helpers with detailed invariants.

## What it covers

- GCD / extended GCD
- Modular arithmetic and inverses
- CRT and modular exponentiation
- Combinatorics helpers

## Pseudocode sketch

```mbt nocheck
g = gcd(a, b)
inv = mod_inv(a, mod)
```

## Notes

- This package is a reference implementation with invariants
